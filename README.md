### Fonts

Used font for body sections (regular text) from family "**Palanquin**" and sans-serif style.  
Used font for headingy sections (titles and subtitles) from family "**Bentham**" and sans-serif style.  
Palanquin and Bentham are both interesting fonts where Palanquin is a clean, modern sans-serif font, while Bentham has a decorative, serif style with flourishes. Palanquin excels for body text due to its clarity. Best practice and decision is to use Bentham for headings to add a touch of personality, while using Palanquin for body text to ensure readability.

## Testing

### Manual Testing

The process of manually testing a website can be as straightforward as accessing a web page or application in a controlled environment, manually navigating through a series of predetermined test scenarios, and recording the outcomes of each test on a spreadsheet. This initial approach is commonly adopted by software teams when they initially prioritize quality assurance.

Basic knowledge of HTML elements and CSS properties is helpful in identifying potential issues and fixing them. 

Testing process was continuously applied through the time of building the website. 
- Browsers used for cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness:
  - Chrome as the primary development tool
  - Edge, Opera, Brave, Min, SlimJet, Falkon and Iron
- Devices used for testing purposes: 
  - desktop devices with Windows 10 and 11 OS were used, from 11" to 15" screen size
  - tablet devices were unavailable, option with browser Dev Tools applied
  - mobile devices were Nokia X10, Samsung Galaxy M13, Samsung Galaxy A10 and Samsung Galaxy J6 (as obsolete device)

**Testing Process:**
- *Tested Content*: Before adding actual content, inserted some test content into HTML file and run it in web browser to ensure that the code is working as expected.
- *User Interface (UI)*: Verified the layout, visual design, and overall user experience. Checked for consistent formatting, proper image loading, and readability across different screen sizes.
- *Readability*: Examined displayed text (font family, font size, color contrast).
- *Navigation*: Tested all navigation elements like menus, buttons, and links. Ensured they lead to the correct destination pages and function smoothly.
- *Forms & Functionality*: Tested form (contact) to be sure it submit data correctly, provide clear error messages for invalid inputs, and follow expected functionalities, sending data.
- *Content Accuracy*: Reviewed all website content for accuracy, grammar, and spelling mistakes. Verified that descriptions and other information are up-to-date and consistent.
- *Responsiveness*: Validated responsiveness of the website loading Dev Tools option of split screen and resized the browser window across different browsers.
  
| Functionality | Expectation | Grade |
|--------------|-------------------------|------|

| footer | are elements visible | pass |
| footer | are elements functional | pass |
| form | is it form displayed as expected | pass |
| form | are form functions working | pass |
| 404 | is page approachable | pass |

## Deployment

### Local Deployment

To test and view HTML5 and CSS3 project locally, a simple server environment needs to be set up on personal computer. This essentially mimics a web hosting service, but runs on private machine. Let's walk through the steps involved...  
- Choose a code editor of your preference like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, or Brackets. These editors provide syntax highlighting and other functionalities for web development.
- Organize your HTML and CSS files in a *folder structure*. Typically, you'll have an index.html file as your main webpage and other HTML files for different sections. CSS files can be in a separate CSS folder. All together can be placed in the *My Documents* subfolder on Windows.
- As HTML and CSS are languages easily interpreted in the browser of choice, once index.html file is created it's content can be displayed opening that file in browser
- For everything to work and display properly attention needs to be on using of *relative path* code structure
- Test the layout and functionality on different browsers (*Portable Browsers*).
- Use the browser's developer tools (*Inspect* or **F12**) to inspect and debug any styling issues.

<details>
<summary>Local deployment structure image <b style="color: yellow;">(open here)</b></summary>
<p>Local development occurs on personal computer or mobile device, and only available to person who has access to the same computer. No one in outside world can access and view those pages.</p>
<img src="assets/documentation/deployment-local.webp">

Or to simplify if Repository for the project is already created on GitHub all content of the project can be downloaded over the action button and option "Download".

<details>
<summary>GitGub option to download full project in once <b style="color: yellow;">(open here)</b></summary>
<p>If all of the changes are saved (CTRL+S) and content updated on GitHub (git push) download of full project is available over green button "Code" and option "Download ZIP"</p>

### Cloud Deployment

Here's a step-by-step process for deploying your website on GitHub Pages:  

- **Prepare your Website Files**
  - Build your website files locally using your preferred framework (HTML, CSS, Javascript etc.).
  - Ensure your website has an index.html, index.md, or README.md file, as GitHub Pages looks for this as the entry point.
  - Organize your website files into a clear structure for easy navigation.
- **Create a GitHub Repository**
  - If you don't have one already, create a new account and repository on GitHub.com.
  - Push your website files to the newly created repository using Git commands or the GitHub desktop application.
- **Configure Publishing Source (Using Branch)**
  - Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
  - Navigate to the "*Code and automation*" section and click "*Pages*".
  - Under "*Build and deployment*", choose "*Deploy from a branch*" in the "*Source*" section.
  - Select the branch containing your website files from the "*Branch" dropdown menu. Optionally, choose a specific folder within the branch using the "*Folder" dropdown menu (useful for subdirectory deployments).
  - Click "*Save*" to activate your website deployment.
- **Accessing Your Deployed Website**
  - This live site is on the location: *https://silver25.github.io/southern-farm/*

<details>
<summary>Deployment on Cloud (GitGub) <b style="color: yellow;">(open here)</b></summary>
<p>Once configured, GitHub Pages will automatically build and publish your website.</p>
